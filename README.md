## Building
Create a `keys.dart` file in the `lib/config/` folder and add the following code snippet in the `keys.dart`:

```dart 
class Keys {
  static String admobAppId = 'your admob app id';
  static String addUnitId = 'your admob add unit id';
  static String theMovieDb = 'your https://www.themoviedb.org api key';
  static String sentryDsn = 'your sentry Dsn';
}
```
### Apk
To build the **free** version:
```console
flutter build apk --release --flavor free -t lib/main.dart
```

To build the **pro** version
```
flutter build apk --release --flavor pro -t lib/main_pro.dart
```

**Explanation:** The `flavor` option makes sure that in Android the `build.gradle` is using the right build flavors (including different applicationId).
The `target` option (-t) makes sure we can use the different flavors in the dart code.

**VSCode:** Go to the debug tab (ctrl + shift + D) and select on top the debug configuration and there will be 2 available options: `Flutter Free` and `Flutter Pro`.
These configurations will build the app with the commands given above.

### App bundles (preferred)
To build the **free** version:
```console
flutter build appbundle --flavor free -t lib/main.dart
```

To build the **pro** version
```
flutter build appbundle --flavor pro -t lib/main_pro.dart
```
